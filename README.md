## Game Overview

Snake and Ladder is a simple and fun game for 2 or more players. The objective is to reach the final square by rolling a die and moving forward. The game board has numbered squares, some of which contain ladders and snakes:

- **Ladders**: Move up to a higher square.
- **Snakes**: Slide down to a lower square.

## Installation

To install and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-and-ladder.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd snake-and-ladder
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any). For example, in Python:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter the number of players and their names.

3. Players take turns rolling a virtual die, and their pieces move forward based on the number rolled.

4. If a player lands on a square with a ladder, they move up to the top of the ladder. If they land on a square with a snake, they slide down to the tail of the snake.

5. The first player to reach or exceed the final square wins!

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a board with 100 squares, numbered 1 to 100.
- Players take turns rolling a die and move forward the number of squares rolled.
- If a player rolls a 6, they get an additional turn.
- Landing exactly on the last square (100) wins the game. If the roll exceeds 100, the player must wait until their next turn to try again.
- Ladders move the player up; snakes move the player down.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
